/*
Dummy data
starts with 1 =History
starts with 2 =Geography
starts with 3 =Science

Reason for this is that we can't have the same number for fact_topic because we have it as a UNIQUE to use it in
the question table, if we dont insert UNIQUE then we can have the same number for each topic but we cant use it in other table.

Also removed fact_sub_id serial references fact_submission(fact_sub_id) for the time to make it easier to
make the data.
