# Node server + quiz feature

Contains the node server we will be using in the final product alongside the quiz code.
The topics, questions and answers are stored in a database which the server communicates with.
The server queries the database, packages the information in a JSON object and sends it to the client.
The client then uses that to display it to the user using Javascript.

* Node modules not included
